# ft_turing:

This is project from 42 on Turing machines implementation.

The assignement consists in making an executable using the functional paradigm that would take a Turing machine description, implement it, then run it.

For this reason we decided to use a Lisp language because the list handling affinities for representations, but even more to take advantage of the Lisp macros features.

We choose Common Lisp with the CLisp interpreter.
